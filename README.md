***FHOT 2.0*** is a virtual reality hotel simulation I developed for **Meta Quest 3** during my internship at the ***[Helsinki XR Center](https://helsinkixrcenter.com/)***. It is a continuation of my first project, FHOT 1.0, with an expanded environment, interactions, and AI-driven interactive NPCs.
